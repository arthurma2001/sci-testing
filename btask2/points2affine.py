# Continuing from Required Task 3 above,
# create a Python function that will find the affine transformation between two sets of 2D or 3D correspondence points.
# The affine transformation is a linear transformation and translation that can be expressed in a single matrix,
# 3x3 in the 2D case and 4x4 in the 3D case. See the Wikipedia page for more information. With a set of corresponding points,
# the affine transformation can be found by solving for the coefficients of the affine transformation in the least squared sense.

# Create a Python function that will use the affine transformation calculated for 2D points to combine two images into one. Create some test code using pytest.
